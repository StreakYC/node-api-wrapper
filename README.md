NodeJS Wrapper for Streak API
================

NodeJS package that acts as a thin wrapper over the Streak API. You can checkout the full API documentation at https://www.steak.com/api

To include the api just do the standard
> node install streak

and then
> var Streak = require('streakAPI');

> Streak.init('api_key');

The actual API is very straightforward and the best way to know what functions are available is to read the source.
